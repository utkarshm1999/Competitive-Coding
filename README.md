# Competitive-Coding
This repository contains codes I have written  for problem statements from the various competitive coding websites.
The websites I am majorly focussing upon are :
1. Codechef
2. Hackerrank

Date: 08/06/2018 : Its been 2 days I had been writing this code, and reaching no where. This morning I great algorithm just hit me and I completed the code in just 5 minutes. So i learnt 2 things:  First, to work on algorithm with all that you got to come up with the best possible. For the past 2 days,the code that I wrote were on an algorithm that even I wasnt completely sure of. It worked for the test cases and so I went up with it. Secondly, do not overestimate the level of a question. This hindered me for the past 2 days to think of a simple algorithm.
